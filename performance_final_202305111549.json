            "question": "In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?",
            "answer": "We can analyze each option and determine which one is true for an X-linked recessive disorder:\n\nA) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder.\n- This statement is not true because not all descendants on the maternal side will necessarily inherit the affected X chromosome.\n\nB) Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family.\n- This statement is not true because males are more likely to be affected by X-linked recessive disorders since they only have one X chromosome. If they inherit the affected gene, they will express the disorder. Females have two X chromosomes and must inherit the affected gene from both parents to be affected.\n\nC) All daughters of an affected male will be affected.\n- This statement is not completely true. All daughters of an affected male will inherit the affected X chromosome, but they will not necessarily be affected if they also inherit a normal X chromosome from their mother. In this case, they would be carriers of the disorder but not affected.\n\nD) There will be an equal distribution of males and females affected.\n- This statement is not true because, as mentioned earlier, males are more likely to be affected by X-linked recessive disorders than females.\n\nFrom the analysis above, the closest option to being true is C) All daughters of an affected male will be affected. However, it is important to note that daughters of an affected male will not necessarily be affected, but they will at least be carriers of the disorder.",
