Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?",

Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.\u201d Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776 Which of the following \u201cmiseries\u201d alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary era?",
