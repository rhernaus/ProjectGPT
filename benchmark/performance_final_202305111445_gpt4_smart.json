Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.\u201d Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776 Which of the following \u201cmiseries\u201d alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary era?",

This unsustainable agricultural practice led to soil depletion, making it difficult for the Maya to grow crops and support their population. Evidence of this degradation has been found in soil samples and through the study of ancient Maya agricultural practices. Additionally, paleoclimatic records indicate that the region experienced several droughts during the time of the Maya civilization, which, when combined with the ecological degradation, could have severely impacted their food production and contributed to their decline.",

            "answer": "D) The POP would reject the 'system of natural liberty.' Reason: In Rawls' theory, people in the original position are unaware of their personal attributes and social standing. As a result, they would likely reject a system that allows for significant inequalities based on natural endowments and the free market, as it could put them at a disadvantage. Instead, they would seek a more just and equitable society, which aligns with Rawls' principles of justice as fairness.",

The music from the neighbor's home was so loud that the examinee couldn't fall asleep. The examinee called the neighbor and asked her to please keep the noise down. The neighbor then abruptly hung up. Angered, the examinee went into his closet and got a gun. He went outside and fired a bullet through the neighbor's living room window. Not intending to shoot anyone, the examinee fired his gun at such an angle that the bullet would hit the ceiling. He merely wanted to cause some damage to the neighbor's home to relieve his angry rage. The bullet, however, ricocheted off the ceiling and struck a partygoer in the back, killing him. The jurisdiction makes it a misdemeanor to discharge a firearm in public. The examinee will most likely be found guilty for which of the following crimes in connection to the death of the partygoer?",

            "question": "Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?",
